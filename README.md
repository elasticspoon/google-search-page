The goal of this project is to recreate a google search result page using basic css and html. 
Compared to the google homepage recreated earlier this time I will attempt to make my html and css more organized. 


I plan to recreate the page elements from the smallest element up so they fit together in a better manner. 
I also belive that construsting the page from the smallest elements up will result in a cleaner html and css afterwards.
